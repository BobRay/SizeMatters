<p>SizeMatters records and displays a record of the viewport width (in both Ems and CSS Pixels) of
the visitors to your site. It also shows the font size used.</p>

<h3>Installing SizeMatters</h3>

<p>
    Go to Extras | Installer on the main menu in the MODX Manager and click on the &quot;Download
    Extras&quot; button. That will take you to the Revolution Repository (AKA Web Transport
    Facility). Put SizeMatters in the search box and press Enter. Click on the &quot;Download&quot;
    button, and once the package is downloaded, click on the &quot;Back to Package Manager&quot;
    button. That should bring you back to your Package Management grid. Click on the
    &quot;Install&quot; button next to SizeMatters in the grid. The SizeMatters package should now be
    installed.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>To start recording, put this tag anywhere in the body section of a Template or at the end of
    the Resource Content field of a resource.</p>

<pre class="brush: html; toolbar: false;"><fixedpre>
[[!SizeMatters]]
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="box">
    <p>SizeMatters writes a short line of text to the raw data file (<code>core/components/sizematters/logs/log.txt</code>)
    each time a page with the SizeMatters snippet tag is visited. The file can get very large depending on
    how many pages are involved and how busy your site is. The recommended place for the tag is at the end of
    the Resource Content field for your home page. If the tag is in a Template that's used by a lot
    of pages, the log can grow very big, very fast. The PHP process that analyzes the data and draws the
    graphs may time out.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The snippet just injects a small amount of JavaScript code that calls a processor asynchronously, so it shouldn't
have much effect on page-load times.</p>

<p>To show the results, just view the SizeMatters Show Graphs resource. You can control which graphs are shown and whether or not they are up-to-date with the properties of the SizeMattersShowGraphs snippet on that page.</p>

<pre class="brush: html; toolbar: false;"><fixedpre>
[[!SizeMattersShowGraphs?
    &showEms=`1`
    &refreshEms=`1`
    &showPxs=`1`
    &refreshPxs=`1`
    &showFonts=`1`
    &refreshFonts=`1`
]]
</fixedpre></pre>


<p>The three <code>&show</code> properties determine whether each graph is shown. The three <code>&refresh</code>
properties determine whether a new graph is drawn before showing it. Processing the raw values and drawing
each graph takes time (especially for the Pixels graph), so you may want to turn refreshing off once you have a significant amount of data
 to display, and turn it back on periodically to bring the graphs up to date.</p>

<p>If the raw data file has grown very large, the analysis of the data and graph drawing may cause a PHP timeout.
    In that case, you won't see the graphs and may see a blank page. If this turns out to be a common problem, I
may rewrite the code to extract the processed data to a much smaller file when refreshing things.</p>

<p>If your site is very busy, you may choose to put the tag in the Resource Content field of a page
that's not visited very often.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Using the Information</h3>


<p>It's generally a bad practice to code for specific devices, but it's nice to know the
    viewport sizes used by your site's visitors. Keep in mind the fact that if no one is visiting
    your site with mobile devices, it may be because your site looks terrible on a phone. As you
    alter your site's design, you can delete the log file, rename the images to save them, and
    see if the new design is attracting more mobile or tablet users.</p>

<p>Once you have enough data, SizeMatters may help you fine-tune the breakpoints you use in your
    media queries. Any responsive design strategy involves compromises, and seeing the
    distribution of viewport widths for your site visitor may help with those decisions.</p>

<p>At some point, if there is some demand for it, I may add a feature to show the percentages of
    users visiting with phone, tablet,  laptop, and desktop devices.</p>

<p>How to approach Responsive site design is controversial, but doing a mobile-first design is
    a common recommendation. I like using Ems and percentages almost exclusively. (Please don't
    use this site as an example until I get around to making it responsive &mdash; I beg you not
    to look at the current CSS and HTML used at Bob's Guides &mdash; it's an embarrassing,
    shoemaker's child mess.)
</p>

<p>In a mobile-first design, the CSS at the top of your CSS file is for mobile devices. Once you
    have the site looking good on a phone, you add media queries that modify the site for larger
    devices. The breakpoints you use will depend on what SizeMatters tells you, and your
    particular site's requirements. Using Ems and percentages helps with that, as does having a
    meta viewport tag in the head section of all your Templates. Generally, the only thing I use
    pixels for is border widths. You can even do drop shadow and border radius values in Ems. The
    width of divs, imo, is best specified in percentages, and you can set the font-size of the
    <code>body</code> section as either 1 Em or 100%, so the user's browser defaults will set
    the font size, and pinching and zooming will work as expected.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Testing Your Responsive Design</h3>

<p>If you can't afford a device simulator, and you're doing your development on a localhost
    install (so you can't use any of the online simulators), a nice substitute is the device
    simulator in Google Chrome's Dev. Tools. At present, Firefox's simulations just involve
    shrinking the browser window. Chrome actually responds with the viewport's correct
    dimensions, and where appropriate, the pixel density. In other words, it responds 
    correctly to media queries in your CSS. Whenever I've used it, and later
    tested on the actual devices, the simulation has been dead on.</p>

<p>To use Chrome's simulator, go into Dev. Tools (Ctrl-shift-i). At the left side of its menu,
    you'll see a box with a smaller box inset. Clicking on that will take you to the device
    simulator. At the top of the screen, there's a report on the current device being simulated
    and a drop-down menu for switching to another device. At the bottom of the drop-down menu,
    there's an 'Edit' option that lets you add devices to the list.</p>

<p>At the right side of the device description at the top of the screen, there's an angled
   icon that will let you switch from portrait to landscape mode. You can control what's
   displayed in the device description by clicking on the three dots to the far right of the
   description line. There, you can also capture a screen shot of the device's display.</p>

<p>To exit the simulator, just click again on the simulator icon at the left end of the Dev. 
    Tools menu.</p>

<p>How SizeMatters Works</p>

<p>SizeMatters injects JavaScript into the page that asks the browser about the font size and viewport
width (not the device with, because ... who cares). The results may depend on whether you have a
meta viewport tag and what's in it. The JS sends a the three data points to a processor with and
asynchronous Ajax call. The JS is vanilla (no Jquery). The processor sanitizes the data
and records it as a single line in a CSV data file.</p>

<p>If the <code>&refresh</code> option is on, the SizeMattersShowGraphs snippet reads and
    analyzes the data from  the file and sends it to the graphing software, which creates a .png
    image for each graph, then the graphs are displayed (depending on the <code>&show</code>
    properties) with a standard <code>img</code> tag.</p>

<p>If the <code>&refresh</code> option is off, the existing (possibly out-of-date) graphs are shown.</p>

<p>The graphs are produced with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pchart.net/">pChart 2.0</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Security Issues</h3>

<p>As far as I know, there aren't any. The processor that writes the data will only write very
    short lines containing only numbers and commas. It converts all input to numbers. The code
    that processes the data also converts everything to numbers and all it does with the data is
    send it to the graphing software. There is no database access at any point, and even if
    someone managed to introduce malicious code, all it would do is confuse the graphing software.</p>

    <p>As always, it's strongly recommended that you <a href="https://rtfm.modx.com/revolution/2.x/administering-your-site/security/hardening-modx-revolution" target="_blank">harden your
        MODX site</a> so that the core directory is not accessible via URL, either by moving the
    core above the web root, or adding the appropriate .htaccess file (I prefer the first method).</p>
