<p>SizeMatters records and displays a record of the viewport width (in both Ems and CSS Pixels) of
the visitors to your site. It also shows the font size used.</p>

<h3>Installing SizeMatters</h3>

<p>
    Go to Extras | Installer on the main menu in the MODX Manager and click on the &quot;Download
    Extras&quot; button. That will take you to the Revolution Repository (AKA Web Transport
    Facility). Put SizeMatters in the search box and press Enter. Click on the &quot;Download&quot;
    button, and once the package is downloaded, click on the &quot;Back to Package Manager&quot;
    button. That should bring you back to your Package Management grid. Click on the
    &quot;Install&quot; button next to SizeMatters in the grid. The SizeMatters package should now be
    installed.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>To start recording, put this tag anywhere in the body section of a Template or at the end of
    the Resource Content field of a resource.</p>

<pre class="brush: html; toolbar: false;"><fixedpre>
[[!SizeMatters]]
</fixedpre></pre>


<div class="box">To see the results, view the SizeMattersShowGraphs resource. You will get an &quot;Insufficient Data&quot; message until about 100 hits have occurred. </div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>Devices</h3>

<p>Almost all responsive design gurus recommend against designing for specific devices for lots of good reasons. Out of curiosity, though, if you want to examine which devices are visiting your site, there's a nice list of common devices and their widths <a href="http://www.canbike.org/CSSpixels/" target="_blank">Here</a>. You want to look at the right-most two columns: Device Width and Device Height. These are expressed in
    <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/04/a_pixel_is_not.html" target="_blank">CSS pixels</a>. Keep in mind that SizeMatters will record the larger of the two values if the device is in landscape mode.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="box">
    <p>SizeMatters appends a short line of text to the raw data file (<code>core/components/sizematters/logs/log.txt</code>)
    each time a page with the SizeMatters snippet tag is visited. If you put the tag in a Template used by a lot of pages there is a slight chance of data loss as many processes try to write to the file at the same time. The recommended place for the tag is at the end of
    the Resource Content field for your home page. If your site doesn't get a lot of visitors, you may choose to put it on more pages, especially at first.</p>

    <p>If your site is extremely busy, you may choose to put the tag in the Resource Content field of a page that's not visited very often.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The snippet just injects a small amount of JavaScript code that calls a processor asynchronously, so it shouldn't
have much effect on page-load times.</p>

<p>To show the results, just view the SizeMatters Show Graphs resource. You can control which graphs are shown and whether or not they are up-to-date with the properties of the SizeMattersShowGraphs snippet on that page. Change the <code>1</code> to a <code>0</code> to omit a graph. Leaving out some of the graphs (especially the pixels graph) can make the rendering much faster.</p>

<pre class="brush: html; toolbar: false;"><fixedpre>
[[!SizeMattersShowGraphs?
    &showEms=`1`
    &showPxs=`1`
    &showFonts=`1`
    &showPie=`1`
]]
</fixedpre></pre>



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Using the Information</h3>


<p>It's generally a bad practice to code for specific devices, but it's nice to know the
    viewport sizes used by your site's visitors. Keep in mind the fact that if no one is visiting
    your site with mobile devices, it may be because your site looks terrible on a phone. As you
    alter your site's design, you can delete the log file, rename the images to save them, and
    see if the new design is attracting more mobile or tablet users.</p>

<p>Once you have enough data, SizeMatters may help you fine-tune the breakpoints you use in your
    media queries. Any responsive design strategy involves compromises, and seeing the
    distribution of viewport widths for your site visitor may help with those decisions.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Pie Chart</h3>
<p>The Pie Chart shows the percentages of users visiting with phone, tablet,  laptop, and desktop devices (or whatever you specify). It can be configured by changing the values in the SizeMattersPieConfig chunk, or by creating a new config chunk and specifying it in the <code>&pieConfigChunk</code> property.</p>

<p>The SizeMattersPieConfig chunk looks like this (this example uses Ems as the unit):</p>

<pre class="brush: html; toolbar: false;"><fixedpre>
unit:em
Phones:0:29.99
Tablets:30:47.99
Laptops:48:63.99
Desktops:64:99.99
Lg. Desktops:100:9999
</fixedpre></pre>

The unit (<code>em</code> or <code>px</code>) must go on the first line. Each line below must be in the form:
<pre class="brush: html; toolbar: false;"><fixedpre>
Label:min:max
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>Each line except the first must have exactly two colons, and <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> must be specified in the unit specified in the first line (they can have decimal points).</p>

<p>You can use as many or as few lines as you like (within reason). You might, for example, choose to have just three classes (e.g., phones, tablets, other). If you already have media queries in your CSS, you might want to use those breakpoints.</p>

<p>The default SizeMatterPieConfig chunk uses ems. There is an alternative config chunk called SizeMattersPieConfig2 that uses pixels as the unit. If you want to use it, just include <code>&pieConfigChunk=`SizeMattersPieConfig2</code> in the SizeMatters snippet tag on the SizeMattersShowGraphs resource.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="box">
    <p>Because of the way the calculations are made, and browser anomalies, the percentages may differ (sometimes significantly) depending on whether you use ems or pixels as the unit, even if you try to make the breakpoints the same. For example, at extremely small zoom levels (zommed out), a bug in Chrome leads it to report a larger font size (even though the font is actually smaller). This will affect the ems calculation, but not the pixel calculation, making the percentages diverge. The zoom level must be fairly extreme for this to happen, so the odds are that you won't experience it.</p>

    <p>Some devices (notably Kindle HDXs) will jack up the font size to compensate for their higher pixel density. SizeMatters tries to correct for this, but the correction is not perfect.</p>
</div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Disabling SizeMatters</h3>

<p>You can disable writing to the <code>log.txt</code> file by simply removing the SizeMatters snippet tag anywhere it exists. The JS will not be injected and no SizeMatters code will run when pages load. If you've had enough visitors to create the three data files (about 100 visits), you can still look at the graphs on the SizeMattersShowGraphs page.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Starting Over</h3>

<p>If you've just made your site responsive, you may get a lot more mobile visitors. You might want to save the current graphs and start over to get an accurate look at the new visitors. The images are in the <code>assets/components/sizematters/images/</code> directory and they can be viewed directly by appending that URL to your site URL and adding the filename at the end. If you rename them periodically, you can see how the distribution of visitors changes over time.</p>

<p>After renaming the image files, delete the three data files: <code>ems.data</code>, <code>pxs.data</code>, <code>fonts.data</code>. Then, either edit the <code>log.txt</code> file and save it empty, or delete it and recreate it. <b>Important: </b> Make sure the <code>log.txt</code> file exists when you're finished.</p>

<p>All the data files are in the <code>core/components/sizematters/logs/</code> directory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musings on Responsive Design</p>

<p>How to approach Responsive site design is controversial, but doing a mobile-first design is
    a common recommendation. I like using Ems and percentages almost exclusively. (Please don't
    use this site as an example until I get around to making it responsive &mdash; I beg you not
    to look at the current CSS and HTML used at Bob's Guides &mdash; it's an embarrassing,
    shoemaker's-child mess.)
</p>

<p>In a mobile-first design, the CSS at the top of your CSS file is for mobile devices. Once you
    have the site looking good on a phone, you add media queries that modify the site for larger
    devices. The breakpoints you use will depend on what SizeMatters tells you, and your
    particular site's requirements. Using Ems and percentages helps with that, as does having a
    meta viewport tag in the head section of all your Templates. Generally, the only thing I use
    pixels for is border widths. You can even do drop shadow and border radius values in Ems. The
    width of divs, imo, is best specified in percentages, and you can set the font-size of the
    <code>body</code> section as either 1 Em or 100%, so the user's browser defaults will set
    the font size, and pinching and zooming will work as expected.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Testing Your Responsive Design</h3>

<p>If you can't afford a device simulator, and you're doing your development on a localhost
    install (so you can't use any of the online simulators), a nice substitute is the device
    simulator in Google Chrome's Dev. Tools. At present, Firefox's simulations just involve
    shrinking the browser window. Chrome actually responds with the viewport's correct
    dimensions, and where appropriate, the pixel density. In other words, it responds 
    correctly to media queries in your CSS. Whenever I've used it, and later
    tested on the actual devices, the simulation has been dead on.</p>

<p>To use Chrome's simulator, go into Dev. Tools (Ctrl-shift-i). At the left side of its menu,
    you'll see a box with a smaller box inset. Clicking on that will take you to the device
    simulator. At the top of the screen, there's a report on the current device being simulated
    and a drop-down menu for switching to another device. At the bottom of the drop-down menu,
    there's an 'Edit' option that lets you add devices to the list.</p>

<p>At the right side of the device description at the top of the screen, there's an angled
   icon that will let you switch from portrait to landscape mode. You can control what's
   displayed in the device description by clicking on the three dots to the far right of the
   description line. There, you can also capture a screen shot of the device's display.</p>

<p>To exit the simulator, just click again on the simulator icon at the left end of the Dev. 
    Tools menu.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How SizeMatters Works</p>

<p>SizeMatters injects JavaScript into the page that asks the browser about the font size and viewport
width (not the device with, because ... who cares). The results may depend on whether you have a
meta viewport tag and what's in it. The JS sends a the three data points (px, em, font) to a processor with an
asynchronous Ajax call. The JS is vanilla (no Jquery). The processor sanitizes the data and won't process lines containing anything but numbers and commas. The processor then records the data as a single line in a CSV data file: <code>log.txt</code> in the <code>core/components/sizematters/logs/</code> directory. The <code>log.txt</code> file is human-readable, but should never be edited directly. </p>

<p>The <code>log.txt</code> file would get immense, especially on busy sites. To prevent this, whenever it's over 1000 bytes, (about 100 visitors). The processor locks the file, reads it, updates the three data files (<code>pxs.data</code>, <code>ems.data</code>, <code>fonts.data)</code> &mdash; also in the <code>core/components/sizematters/logs/</code>, and empties the <code>log.txt</code> file. Then it unlocks the file.</p>

<p>The contents of the three data files are what the snippet that draws the graphs sends to the graphing software (after a little massaging). This means that updating the log file, updating the data files, and drawing the graphs will never slow down, regardless of how long the program has been running. The three data files are created with PHP's <code>serialize()</code> function, so unlike the <code>log.txt</code> file, they appear as gibberish when viewed. They are read and parsed very quickly. Most of the time it takes for the SizeMattersShowGraphs page to show up is spent inside the graphing software. Looking at the graphs, you can see why.</p>

<p>The graphs are produced with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pchart.net/">pChart 2.0</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Security Issues</h3>

<p>As far as I know, there aren't any. The processor that writes the data will only write very
    short lines containing only numbers and commas. It converts all input to numbers. The code
    that processes the data also converts everything to numbers and all it does with the data is
    send it to the graphing software. There is no database access at any point, and even if
    someone managed to introduce malicious code, all it would do is confuse the graphing software.</p>

    <p>As always, it's strongly recommended that you <a href="https://rtfm.modx.com/revolution/2.x/administering-your-site/security/hardening-modx-revolution" target="_blank">harden your
        MODX site</a> so that the core directory is not accessible via URL, either by moving the
    core above the web root, or adding the appropriate .htaccess file (I prefer the first method).</p>
