<h3>CSS Pixels Graph</h3>

<p>The graph below shows the distribution of visitors' viewport widths in <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/04/a_pixel_is_not.html">CSS pixels</a>. A CSS pixel is roughly 1/96 of an inch. In other words, an element that is 96 CSS pixels wide, at a zoom level of 100% will span about an inch regardless of the device being used.</p>

<p>Values greater than 2000px are rounded down to 2000px.</p>
