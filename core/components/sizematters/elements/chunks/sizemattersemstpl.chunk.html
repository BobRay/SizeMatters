<h3>Ems Graph</h3>

<p>This chart shows the distribution of visitors by the width of their viewport expressed in <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/taking-the-erm-out-of-ems--webdesign-12321">Ems.</a> This is my favorite measure because it takes into account the font size being used. It's calculated with this formula: <code>Math.round( width / parseFloat(font_size));</code> where both width and font_size are expressed in <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/04/a_pixel_is_not.html">CSS Pixels</a>.</p>
