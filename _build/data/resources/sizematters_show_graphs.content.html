    <h3>Who's Visiting with What?</h3>

    <p>If your web site has a responsive design, you may be interested in fine-tuning the design based
        on the actual devices your visitors are using. It's generally a bad idea to design for specific
        devices, but it's nice to know how many of your users users are visiting using phone, tablet,
        laptop, and desktop devices. The values reflect the viewport width, not the device width, so if
        the user has the browser smaller than full-screen, the recorded width values will be
        smaller.</p>

    <p>SizeMatters uses JavaScript to ask the browser the viewport width in Ems and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/04/a_pixel_is_not.html">CSS pixels</a>, and the
        current font size in px. The taller the bar in the graph, the more users are visiting with that
        value. There's more information in the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://bobsguides.com/sizematters-tutorial.html">SizeMatters
            documentation</a> at Bob's Guides.</p>

    <p>Take the specific values in the graphs with a grain of salt. There are plenty of browser and
        device anomalies and results may depend on whether or not you have a meta viewport tag (and
        what's in it). Still, in my experiments, the values are very close and can almost always be used
        to identify specific devices (not that you should do that).</p>

    <p>The graphs are done with <a href="http://www.pchart.net/" target="_blank">pChart 2.0</a>.</p>
