SizeMatters records and displays the actual viewport widths of your site's visitors in both Ems and CSS Pixels. It also shows the font size used by each visitor. 

The results are in the form of graphs showing the frequency for each size. The taller the bar, the more visitors with that value. There is also a configurable pie chart showing the distribution of visitor in various size categories.
 
 The GD and FreeType libraries are necessary to render the graphs. They're included in most PHP installs.

I hope SizeMatters will be helpful for people who want to fine-tune their responsive media queries and make design decisions based on how many visitors are using various devices (or are just curious about the distribution of visitors' devices).
